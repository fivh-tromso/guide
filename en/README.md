This project aims to give you an easy-to-use overview of where you can find thrift stores, repair your stuff, rent and borrow things, find sustainable food and communities and activities that drive sustainability. By that we don't mean the kind of symbolic sustainability that all the advertisements wave, no. To the f*ck with the overconsumption society, back to reuse, repair, circularity, simple good lives and good communities.

    🗺️ CATEGORIES 🗺️
    
    🎟️📣 Events - upcoming demos and events that are considered to promote sustainable progress and mindsets.
    🛠️👨‍🔧 Repair and tools - Both repairers, rental companies and communities for repairing things and seaweed.
    🍴🌱 Food - In the starting phase, but the idea is for players who focus on food with the lowest climate and environmental footprint, local sustainability and/or animal welfare.
    👕♻️ Clothing and recycling - Second-hand stores that offer nice clothes, furniture, sports equipment, etc. etc.!
    📚🤝 Sharing economy and community - Loans, rentals and joint ownership of things. Libraries in the broader sense, it pays off for the wallet and the planet to increase the useful life of things, from books to cars. sports equipment. Communities and meeting places are good.
    🚌🌄 Travel and experiences - Take the bus or go for a walk in the local area. Rent a car or carpool. An experience in the great outdoors is good, and keeps you away from shopping malls and internet advertisements.

Everything is based on open source code and voluntary efforts. We could therefore always use some help ☺️
